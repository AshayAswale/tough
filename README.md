#### Setting up workspace
Create catkin workspace. If you already have one, move to the nest step    
```bash
    mkdir -p ~/indigo_ws/src && cd ~/indigo_ws/src
    catkin_init_workspace
    cd ~/indigo_ws
    catkin_make
```
Clone the git repository    
```bash
    git clone https://gitlab.com/whrl/space_robotics_challenge.git ~/indigo_ws/src/space_robotics_challenge
```
@TODO: Create a script that would download and configure the environment

After the code is downloaded, run catkin_make.  
```bash
    cd ~/indigo_ws    
    catkin_make
```
