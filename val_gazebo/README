This package has all the models and world files you might find useful in starting on the SRC qualification tasks.


## How to use it

 - open up gazebo with the path to the models folder in GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH
 - insert light_pane and camera_on_stick
 - rosrun image_view2 image_view2 image:=/my_camera/image_raw


A small window should show up with the camera feed. You can also view cameras from within gazebo, using the "topic visualizer". Hit ctrl+t, then find the image topic and click on it.
